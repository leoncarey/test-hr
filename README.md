## How to run?
#### Run this line:

```
npm install
```

#### After, install the `angular-http-server` for run a server in project:

```
npm install -g angular-http-server
```

#### So, run server:

```
angular-http-server
```

#### Open another tab in your terminal. And finally, this:
```
npm start
```


You have now two tabs. One with your little server, and another, is running `gulp`.

You can open the project in [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080){:target="_blank"}
